The base codes for mySql, mongoDB, and more




## MySQL

## MongoDB
### 📌 Query‑Driven Schema Design
Shape schemas around read patterns, not relational structure.
Embed for bounded, co‑accessed data
Reference for large or shared data
Bucket for logs/time‑series

### 🗂️ 2. Data Modeling Patterns
📦 Embedding Use for: profiles, product attributes, small nested data.
🔗 Referencing Use for: reusable entities, large subdocs, many‑to‑many.
🪣 Bucketing Use for: IoT, logs, metrics.

### 🚀 3. Performance Architecture
⚡ Indexing
Index filters, sorts, joins
Use compound indexes
Avoid over‑indexing
Use TTL for ephemeral data

📊 Aggregation Optimization
$match early
Avoid unbounded $lookup
Use $facet for multi‑view analytics

### 🐳 Docker Integration Architecture
MongoDB is often deployed in containers for local development, CI pipelines, or microservice environments.
In production, Atlas replaces the need to run MongoDB inside your own containers — but containers still play a role.
